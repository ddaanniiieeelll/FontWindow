# FontWindow

Gives you a list of all open fonts. If you click on one, the fontwindow will be displayed in the foreground.  
Very useful when working on bigger families and if you have to manage limited screen real estate.

## v0.9
• Use it with the shortcut ctrl + f  
• The list is ordered by the OS/2 weight class, so make sure you have a value there ;)
